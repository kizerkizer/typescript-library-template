# typescript-project-template
Install with `npm install --global tpt`. 

Run `tpt init <project-name>` in a blank directory where you would like to initialize a typescript project named `<project-name>`.

Builds to commonjs for node; es modules for tools like rollup.js, webpack, and for the future; and to commonjs for the inline .test.ts files.

Please improve via PRs as desired!
